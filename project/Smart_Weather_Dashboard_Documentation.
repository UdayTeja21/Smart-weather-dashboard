Overview
The Smart Weather Visualization Dashboard is a responsive, interactive web application that delivers real-time, location-based weather data with beautiful visualizations and intelligent performance optimizations.

This project leverages five key Web APIs to build a dynamic experience that adapts to user network conditions, location, screen space, and system performance.

🎯 Problem It Solves
Users often struggle with:

Inaccurate or delayed weather info while traveling.

Poor performance on low-end networks or devices.

Overwhelming, cluttered weather UIs.

This application solves those issues by:

Using GPS or manual location for accurate local data.

Dynamically adjusting visuals based on network speed.

Rendering only visible components using Intersection Observers.

Performing heavy data calculations in the background using idle time.

Visualizing weather clearly using Canvas animations.

🧩 Web APIs Used
Web API	Purpose
🛰️ Geolocation API	Detects current user location for local weather
🎨 Canvas API	Renders animated weather effects (rain, sun, wind, etc.)
🌐 Network Information API	Adjusts graphic quality and data refresh rates
👁️ Intersection Observer API	Lazy-renders components for performance
⚙️ Background Tasks API	Processes trend analytics during idle time

⚙️ Key Features
📍 Location Services
Automatic GPS detection using Geolocation API

Manual search for any country or city worldwide

Recently searched and popular locations stored in localStorage

🌤️ Weather Display
Live weather info: temperature, humidity, pressure, wind

Beautiful Canvas-based weather visualizations

Rainfall, sun, clouds, wind particles

Real-time temperature gradients

Smart updates every 5 minutes

📶 Network-Adaptive UI
Adjusts visual effects based on connection type (2G/3G/4G)

Reduces animations and data refresh on slow networks using Network Information API

🎯 Performance Optimization
Uses Intersection Observer API to lazy-load only the visible parts of canvas and weather cards
